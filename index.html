                <p>There are many types of spaces that define human culture. We traverse through spaces of all degrees of privacy daily and their connecting paths are where we rarely dwell but are essential for this practice. Streets are the backdrop for our daily conventions and how they are made is an outcome of urban planning and architecture (Laitinen and Cohen 2009, p.3), reflecting on these aspects will give us an idea of contemporary society. To explore the concept streets, we will need to examine it as a space and its evolution with time just as we would with any building or room. Streets are a room bounded by surrounding architecture and just like a room, it frames its surrounding scenery; inductively, streets then frame the architecture. </p><p>The construction of streets and their relation to its surrounding architecture sets the tone for the city. This tone is generally influenced and unified by the political and/or religious unity of the country. In a notable European example, the evolution towards modern city planning with the end goal of creating grand urban spaces, wide, straight streets, long views, and imposingly uniform big buildings (Laitinen and Cohen 2009, p.9), started out with federal regulations to maintain order working towards a uniform national facade. These efforts can be seen by how in 1619, the Swedish government issued town charters with specific requirements (i.e streets should be at least 4.75 meters wide (Laitinen and Cohen 2009, p.68)) to start treating streets as the common space between buildings and as a part of the material structure of a town (Laitinen and Cohen 2009, p.69). This revisal shows the new emphasis on viewing streets as essential public property and an indicator of the civilization that uses it. </p><p>Streets aren’t only the roads with nomenclature such as the famous Abbey Road that is of public knowledge as streets come in all combinations of privacy and publicity. These properties are resulted from the various way streets are used and constructed. Publicly, streets may be a jar for traffic jam that some people get a taste of ten times a week and privately, it may be the corridor that leads you to your king-sized bed where you sulk away the stress of today. If we take away the social constructed vernacular associated with “street”, can we say every place is a street as it will always lead elsewhere and thus the reversible relationship of every location frames the ones adjacent to it and it just depends of your point of view? I will say that is the case, then how you move through any given space follows a street and so the architect who planned the street becomes the dictating voice for the tone of this trip and its sceneries parallel to the Swedish government in the previous example. In other words, the architects are like directors of a movie where you walk through their creation to enjoy the scene. </p>

                        <h3>Longleat House</h3>
                    </div>

                <div class="longleat">
                    <p2>Wiltshire, England 1580</p2>
                    <p>Coming up to the Longleat house, its fortifying, grand spread stands proudly amidst the 900 acres of well-groomed English landscape (BBC 2014). Four elegant stone guardians watches your arrival from atop the roof. The orthogonal and classically order façade dotted with huge panes of glass will irk any visitor closing in onto its front doorstep with a suspicion of being observed. The house welcomes its visitors with broad staircases pouring out in three directions and with enough courage, the visitor can enter the imposing estate.</p>
                    <p>Robert Smythson, the desirable Elizabethan architect responsible for the various homes built across the nation in the sixteenth century is the one whom was employed for the construction of the Longleat house (Life 2014). Though most of the original structure has been lost to time, the original idea for the experience is still present and renewed by architect Christopher Wren (Dorn 2012). Home to some of the most powerful political characters in Britain, the values of these owners are displayed throughout the house. The concept of lineage that is precious to these historic families is proudly exhibited in the form of a genealogy tree at the foot of the Grand Staircase (Dorn 2012); moving up the arrogant Grand Staircase feels like traversing through the collection of achievements founded by generations of the family. With the same intension of showing off, long galleries weaving the rooms together are plastered by magnificent paintings that are collections of famous works as well as portraits revealing the wealth and success of the family (BBC 2014).</p>
                    <p>After being wowed by their repository of worldly possessions, we can move onto their other displays of wealth and superiority. The large windows which daunted your arrival now frame the hundreds of acres of English countryside. Peering out into the greenery, the lawn stretches to where land meets sky and the vastness of lakes and gardens are all property of the same family whose soaring ceiling swallows your presence (Dorn 2012). Moving from room to room, you can’t escape the enveloping windows and in a seemingly never-ending tour of this titanic estate, you are shown a kind of wealth that allows concepts such as having a lounge waiting outside each bedroom. As a visitor, you are in awe, as the owner, they are proud, and as the architect, he is satisfied with that.</p>

                    <h5>Villa Capra</h5>

            </section>
            <div class="rotonda">
                <p2>Vicenza, Italy 1592</p2>
                <p>Perched on a small mound overlooking the suburbs of Vicenza is Villa Capra, the embodiment of symmetry, classical proportions, and harmony. The four different choose your adventure type of paths all lead up to the same temple front of the villa. On one walk up the hill towards the wide pages of stairs, you observe an audience of statues on either side of you looking back while another route guides you with the edge of an agriculture field (Anderson 2013, p.183). This form of complete symmetry on all four sides lets the experience of heading to (or returning to) the home regardless of your previous venture completely symmetrical as well; the impression of the first time visiting the villa and seeing the façade will be recalled again and again whenever you leave and enter the villa even if it was just to take a short hike in the garden.</p>
                <p>Coming up the stairs, the giant, transparent door that leads to an empty circular, domed hall the entire structure is centered around. From each door to the central area to the door parallel to it, nothing obstructs the view. So, climbing the flights and looking through the temple porch, your destination seems to be a doorway leading to the sky. Though it is such a transparent building, from the outside, you’re still in the dark about what the villa really houses.</p>
                <p>Andrea Palladio is the Italian architect responsible for the experience of the Villa Capra. The purpose and typology this building is adhering to is based on the structure and traditions of local villas and with the functionality of agriculture in mind (Kubelik 1986, p.109). Being the work Palladio wanted to embody perfect classical proportions under complete symmetry, visiting the rooms will all see the same scenery and be in the same dimensions; in other words, regardless of how you want to move around the inside of the villa, the experience is the same on all three floors. Without a compass, whichever door you’re heading out of, Palladio’s innovative planning may surprise you with a different scenery every time. As symmetrical as it is, the confidence and certainty of heading to the villa is counterbalanced by leaving it. Depending on which way you’re headed, the path gives you different experiences. </p>
